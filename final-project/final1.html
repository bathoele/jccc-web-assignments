        <p>Welcome to my web page! I hope you enjoy your stay. This page is about classic novels, or fictional narratives. Here are some quotes about books:</p>
        <p class="quote">“If the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction. But there is always the chance that such a book of fiction may throw some light on what has been written as fact.”<br><span class="name">-Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast</span></p>
        <p class="quote">“A classic is a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation. Then it's safe, like a style in architecture or furniture. It's acquired a picturesque dignity to take the place of its fashion.”<br><span class="name">-F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Beautiful and Damned</span></p>
        <p class="quote">“There are two motives for reading a book: one, that you enjoy it; the other, that you can boast about it.”<br><span class="name">-Bertrand Russell, The Conquest of Happiness</span></p><br><br>
